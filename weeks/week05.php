      <h3>Step By Step Power Coding Session Process</h3>
      <ol>
        <li id="Week5Step1">Chit chat - go around the room and ask each student what they liked most about this week in bootstrap</li>
        <li id="Week5Step2"><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download" target="_blank">Download Bootstrap Source Code</a> - have each student download the source code - extract and then drag the folder into sublime3 to inspect what is included. - Review the bootstrap.css &amp; examples folder ( explaining why these can be used as starting points for projects - along with the boilerplate from the next step )</li>
        <li id="Week5Step3">Review these bootstrap classes: <code>container &amp; container-fluid / row / col and col-offset / clearfix</code></li>
        <li id="Week5Step4">Discuss how to add additional pages and link to them - this will have to be a 2 step process - first show them how to do it on the whiteboard and then have each student do it in their browser - easiest way would be to use a bootstrap example (navbar)</li>
        <li id="Week5Step5">Select a Business Theme Replication, First, they need to decide what type of theme they want to replicate. Ideally, something that interests them or something that will help them find a job</li>
        <li id="Week5Step6">Discuss what can be included in a business website, have the Students list them out loud and you write it on the board. Example: about me section, contact form, gallery, services, clients, etc.</li>
        <li id="Week5Step7">Using <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">wrapbootstrap</a> or <a href="http://www.blacktie.co/" target="_blank">Blacktie.co</a> to search for portfolio themes - if they donâ€™t like any here have them search for 1 page bootstrap portfolios</li>
        <li id="Week5Step8">Begin Paper Prototyping the layout</li>
        <li id="Week5Step9">Once that is done, start coding - using inspect element and typing the properties and tags into sublime3</li>
      </ol>
